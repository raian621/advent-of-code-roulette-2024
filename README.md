# Advent of Code 2024 Roulette

This year I'm going to finish the Advent of Code. Totally. And since I didn't do it last year, I'm making it harder for myself this year by picking a random programming language for each day.

## Usage

Running

```sh
./scripts/new-day.sh
```

will create a folder with a single empty source code file `solution.<file-extension>`, an empty script file `run.sh`, and an empty text file, `input.txt`.

You should try to write everything in these three files, reading input from `input.txt` in the `solution.<file-extension>` source code, and write the commands necessary to build and run the solution in `run.sh` script.
